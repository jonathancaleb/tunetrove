# Translations

We currently need help translating the project so our app can be more accessible to everyone worldwide!
The image below is an overview of the language translations that are currently being worked on:
- The smaller red bars indicate that there is a significant amount of translating needed
- We would ideally like each language to reach to green (less translations needed)
- Please feel free to add new languages that are not currently being translated

In order to contribute please use [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/music-player-go/). 
You will need to create an account with Weblate (if you don't already have one) in order to do so.

It would also be greatly appreciated if you could send some [love](https://weblate.org/donate/new/) to the Weblate contributors who made easy translations possible :)
